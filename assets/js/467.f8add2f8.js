Now that you have your trigger component, select it and click “add event for trigger” in the details panel, we will need the OnComponentBeginOverlap event to start us off!

The reason we have the == is to make sure only the player can activate the conversation! Now drag off of the True pin in the branch and get a DoOnce function. Now we come to an interchangeable point, depending on what you're going to do with your conversation BP this will be different!

Ok, once you have opened up your player character put down an event begin, then attach it to a create widget, the HUD Widget BP will go in here! Attach an AddToViewport to the Create Widget (make sure to connect the 2 blue pins together!). Then right click on the blue pin on the CreateWidget and select PromoteToVariable, you can name it whatever you want! That's all you need to do in the BP for now!)

Now put a new Scale Box in the added Wrap Box, then add an Image to that. If you used a Horizontal Box, I set both of the Scales to Full, but the Image Scale too .5. Next Bind both the Scale and the Image to one binding, this will have a Select with False as Collapsed and True as Visible, the Index will be a Public Bool. (Remember to set the Visibility of both to Collapsed by Default.) Also bind the Brush of the Image to a Bining with the Dark Blue Pin set to a Public Variable. Now go to the Conversation BP in the 1Character Node, take out the Enable Conversation Bool and put it in the CharacterLoop Node in the False Branch Section at the end. Now in the /LV Function, add a Bool Output Pin to it, and inside attach it to the Ends With Output Bool. After all these Functions (1Character and CharacterLoop) add in 2 Branches (Or only 1 if you always want pictures, the second branch will toggle this.) the second will be Attached to True (The Falses will be attached to the Set Text), the first Bool will be connected to the Function Output, the second Bool to a Public Bool in the NPC that you will need to add along with an INT Array. Off of the 2nd Branch's True add a Set image Bool off of the Widget, set it to True, then off of that add a New Custom Function. In the Function add 2 Input Pins, a Character Text and an INT (The INT will be set to 0 for the 1Characters, for the CharacterLoop connect it to the LoopCount INT), inside get the Conversation Data and drag a Get off of the Item Array, attach the INT to the Purple Box, off of that get a Cast to your Master Item, from that Get the Item Info and Make a Slate Brush off of the Item Image, off of the Character Purple Box Pin get a Set Item Image and connect it's pin to the Make Slate Brush. Now a Picture of the Item will show up in the corresponding box! (If the Item Image Bool is set to True in the NPC) Now in the Destroy Node in the Reset Function, add a new Branch on the True's of the MR Branches, connect it's Bool to a !=, the First pin will be connected to the INT Array you added to the NPC, the other pin is set to 0. Now off of the False of this Branch you can add a Set Conversation Text and set the text to Out Of Stock, so that if you click on the button and the Merchant no longer has any more of that Item, it will say Out Of Stock and won't let you buy it!
