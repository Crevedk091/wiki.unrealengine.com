Blueprints call native C++ functions, so the overhead is almost entirely in what we call VM overhead. It's not the nodes that are expensive, per se, it's the calling of the nodes that is slow. That's why if you have something that has to operate on 1000 things in a loop, we would probably make that loop internal to a C++ function instead of doing the operation in Blueprints.
