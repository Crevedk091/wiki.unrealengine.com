The script can be modified to account for that by using only the 'x' and 'z' components of the character locations when computing the location of the CameraFocusActor. If you keep the 'y' value fixed, your camera will always see the same side of the level. You could use the clamp angle node to give the camera a little 'room' for rotating by clamping the angle between the world's 'y' axis and the CameraFocusActor's 'y' axis. Implementing this would be a bit more tricky, though. You could also use the system for more than two characters by making sure the characters used for computing the distance vector are the characters with the greatest distance from each other.
