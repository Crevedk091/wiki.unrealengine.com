Steamroll is an Unreal Engine 4 game developed by the small indie team at Anticto.

In Steamroll you are a young engineer in his first day of work and take control of the Scarabeus, the greatest new steam-fuelled vehicle invention, while you try to survive in a crumbling mine and look for a way out. Steamroll is a puzzle game with a touch of arcade action and adventure.

The game targets the Windows, Linux and Mac platforms, and it was released in Steam Early Access on the 30th of September. It will be completed and released as final during the first quarter of 2016.
