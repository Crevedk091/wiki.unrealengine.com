Dear Community, My name is Chris Ioakeimoglou.

I've put some time and effort into re-working my whole Reel, I have been doing FX for a few years now and it will be a fun trip showcasing what i've done in UE4.

The main focus of this showcase will be:

*   Creating Stunning shaders
*   Creating Stunning Effects
*   Maybe even how to optimize your Effects and shaders for Re-use.

The goal will be to have a basic understanding of the Engine capabilities.

### Demo March 2014

The possibilities.

### Magma/Plasma/Toxic Shader

I've made a shader that simulates Lava / Magma (Plasma and toxic included)and possibly more. This is 1 material that got instanced 2 times for saving resources. It's crucial that we re-use our work as much as possible both for saving time and resources. Having parameters and generally the ability to access our material from instances is also a non destructive way of creating new shaders and effects.

### Dissolve Shader

In this effect i created a simple shader that would transition a material from a solid state to a translucent state, It can be modified to make people invisible and so on just like the effects you would see in real life elements like glass or it can take other kind of elements like the Crysis series cloak or the Infiltrator example for UE4 GDC 2013. Just a few to mention.

Again the idea behind this is to re-use it as much as possible externally by creating instances and modifying the parameters on the fly. Can change it's color, Speed of dissolve even the Way it dissolves.
