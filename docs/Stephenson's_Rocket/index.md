Stephenson's Rocket

**Stephenson's Rocket**, The Steam Engine

I had started this project to test and get into simple Blueprint setups, play around with the new material layers, and particle effects. Every animation of the train is bound to keys and particle effects and sounds are bound to animations inside the train Blueprint. The lamp is a separate skeletal mesh, easily attachable/detachable. Track ballasts are physics actors being simulated in real time, wheel sparks are a combination of GPU and CPU particles with light modules. The model itself is approximately 140k tris and consists of 6 materials(which would have been more without material layers.) Black Body was used for the flames and Unreal Engine decal.
