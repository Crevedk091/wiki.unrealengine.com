General Movement Factors
------------------------

Concept

Description

Running Speed

In the past it has been the same forward/back/strafing.

Acceleration

How fast you change direction when moving.

Air Control

How much you can affect the direction of your movement while in the air.

Jump Height

Gravity

Affects how floaty the game feels. With higher gravity, even if the jump impulse is modified to result in the same jump height, youâ€™ll spend less time in the air.

Dodging

Fast low jump in any of the 4 cardinal movement directions, with a sudden deceleration on landing.

Double Jump

Past titles only allowed the double jump to occur at the apex of the jump. UT2004 allowed double jump during dodge, UT3 did not.

Wall Dodge

Ability to perform a dodge while in the air away from a nearby vertical surface.

Impact/Rocket Jumping

Ability to jump extra high by jumping while point impact hammer down or using other splash/impulse providing weapon at cost of some health.

Team Boosting

Ability to provide impact/rocket jumping benefits to teammates, who take no damage in normal team games.
