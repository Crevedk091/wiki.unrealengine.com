Mktwo's Grid Showcase
=====================

Fix All The Grids!
------------------

mktwo's Better Grid is a single-file project (1 Material asset) to 'fix' Epic's UE4 grid, which by default does not scale along with your snap settings, and instead uses red dots to mark where things will snap. My version of the editor grid-material changes things back to the tried and true method of using the actual grid-lines as visual aid.  

Installation
------------

1\. Download zip-file (link below)  
2\. Close the editor if currently running.  
3\. Extract contents of the UE4 folder into your Unreal Engine root folder (for example, 'C:\\UnrealEngine\\4.0\\')
