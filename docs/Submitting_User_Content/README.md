Submitting User Content - Epic Wiki                    

Submitting User Content
=======================

If you want to submit content to Epic for inclusion in a game or project : Thank you! User participation is awesome.

  
As the Unreal Tournament project has grown, we've learned that the best way to ensure quality submissions is with a thorough vetting by the community through the forums. And with the UT Marketplace now online, we'll be doing a strong curation to ensure that all submissions are safe, legal, and functional on the current build of the engine.

  
Until the Marketplace tools are completed, members of Epic's UT development team will personally request submissions of content that has been previously vetted by the community. As such, all WIP and ideas should be posted in the forums; we'll see you there!

  
**Feedback / Iteration**

Generally, the concepts and content we are using in Unreal Tournament go through an iteration and feedback process involving the community, Chris Perna (the UT Art Director), and our artists and designers on the Unreal Tournament [art forums](http://forums.unrealtournament.com/forumdisplay.php?39-UT-Development-Art). Start up a thread, post your work, and ask for feedback. Iterate there and once you have something you consider to be final, update the thread and inform the community.

  
Submitting work in progress files directly to us isn't productive as the person curating the content is simply not going to have time to respond to everyone and give them feedback; community involvement is a vitally important part of our open development process.

  
**Legal (READ ME!)**

When you submit your work, you must include one of the following lines of text in your email or we cannot accept the submission. Just copy and paste and you're good to go:

  
If you ARE an Unreal Engine 4 subscriber, include this line:

**“I agree that this content constitutes a Submission under the Unreal Engine EULA ( [https://www.unrealengine.com/eula](https://www.unrealengine.com/eula) ).”**

If you are NOT an Unreal Engine 4 subscriber, include this line:

**“I agree that this content constitutes a User Contribution under the Epic Games Terms of Service ( [http://epicgames.com/tou](http://epicgames.com/tou) )."**

  
When you submit something, be sure to provide the following pieces of information:

  

  a) Your name (meaning, how you'd like to be credited)

  b) Your preferred contact email address (if different from the one you're sending that email from).

  
And that’s it!
