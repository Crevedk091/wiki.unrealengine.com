Code snippets are a great way to learn about different parts of the engine and framework. They can also be a huge help when you get stuck. We've all been there. You know exactly what you want to do, but you just can't quite figure out the one missing piece of the puzzle that makes it all work. Chances are someone else has done something similar and their code helped you figure it out.

The Code repository is meant to provide the community with a place to post their snippets so the rest of the community can use them for help or inspiration.

-----------

To get started with coding for the editor, visit the [Programming Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/index.html) documentation page. Then, once you have something coded that you want to share, follow the [Get Involved](/index.php?title=Get_Involved "Get Involved") guide and create a page. Add your code to the page, then fill out details about what the code does and add relevant images to show it off.
