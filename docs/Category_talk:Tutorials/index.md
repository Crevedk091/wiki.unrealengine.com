General Discussion
------------------

I think each tutorial should have a blueprint version and a code version where applicable.

First impression feedback: Having tutorials listed in alphabetical order results in next to no organization. Separating tutorials based on topics would be better imo. What do you think? Imagine if the youtube tutorials weren't in playlists.
