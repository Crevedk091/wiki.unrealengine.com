Overview
--------

_Access None_ is one of the more common errors that a new developer will encounter. The two most common _Access None_ errors you will receive is the reference error and the pending kill error.

An Access None reference error is generally caused by not properly setting an active instance of an object/actor into a variable before attempting to access the functions and variables from the blueprint the variable references.

The second error, pending kill, is caused when you are attempting to access an instanced variable after that instance has been marked for destruction.

In the following video, I go into greater details as to how and why these errors are caused as well as how to avoid these errors in your own projects.
