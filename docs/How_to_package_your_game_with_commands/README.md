[Template:Rating](/index.php?title=Template:Rating&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Rating (page does not exist)") This aims to be a quick guide on how to package and distribute your game.

Some points:

*   If you use unreferenced blueprints/objects, you should add them a) using command line or b) by creating a level with all the objects you need to publish in your game (not recomended)
*   Cooking is the proccess of removing unwanted files from your final build
*   You can choose to Pak (like zip) all your content into a single file
*   If you are building a dedicated server, you need to have the compiled version of Unreal or will not work.
*   You will find the RunUAT at UnrealEngine/Engine/Build/BatchFiles
*   Add the command -build if you're using Source Version from Github
*   If the -allmaps flag is used, \[AllMaps\] with valid +Map=\\Game\\Maps\\Map.umap syntax should be added to DefaultEditor.ini
*   Specific maps can be built (must remove -allmaps flag) using the -maps=Map1+Map2+Map3
