Overview
========

An event-driven [Thalmic Myo](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/) plugin for the Unreal Engine 4.

Main method of use is by subscribing to events within your blueprint. You can extend functionality to any blueprint through adding the MyoInterface interface then adding the MyoComponent to that blueprint. This same architecture is available to C++ if you prefer, which also supports both event-driven and polling style use.
