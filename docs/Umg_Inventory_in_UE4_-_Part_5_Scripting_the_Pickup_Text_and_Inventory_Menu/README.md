Umg Inventory in UE4 - Part 5 Scripting the Pickup Text and Inventory Menu

**Description:**

In this video we create the script to display text in-game above our pickups as well as the functionality behind our Inventory Menu itself. This includes how to update the inventory, what happens when an item is clicked on inside our inventory as well as what happens when each button in our pop-up menu is clicked.
