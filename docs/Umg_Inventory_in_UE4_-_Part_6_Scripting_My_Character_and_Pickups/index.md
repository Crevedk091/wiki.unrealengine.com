Umg Inventory in UE4 - Part 6 Scripting My Character and Pickups
================================================================

  

**Author:**

Wes Bunn - Epic Games

**Description:**

In this video we add the script for the player to bring up the Inventory Menu, pickup items, and what happens when they drop an item from their inventory. We also work on our first pickup and add the functionality to it so that it can be picked up and added to the inventory as well as what happens when the player selects to “use” the pickup from the inventory pop-up menu.
