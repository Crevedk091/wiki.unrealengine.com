Prop Hunt Redux
===============

Overview
--------

Prop Hunt is a game of Hide and Seek with a little twist. Players on the “Props” have one whole minute to turn into any object they pick up and must hide before the Hunters can find and kill them. Players on the “Hunters” team have three whole minutes to search through the map trying to find and kill all of the “Props” but Hunters must be very careful, causing damage to a prop that isn't controlled by a player will cause the Hunter to lose some health.

Gameplay
--------

Players will be able to play the famous Prop Hunt gamemode that originated on Garry's Mod, but with a more in depth hiding system, hunter abilities and any more awesome gameplay aspects that will make Prop Hunt Redux a more improved version of Prop Hunt.
