In this wiki I show you how you can maintain shadows at large distances!

The Issue
---------

In older engine versions shadows would fade out very quickly when viewed from afar or at oblique camera angles like in an RTS game.

Well I am so happy to announce that the feature Far Shadows now addresses this matter!
