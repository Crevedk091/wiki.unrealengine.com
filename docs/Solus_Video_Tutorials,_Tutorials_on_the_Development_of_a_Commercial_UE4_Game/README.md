The Solus Project
-----------------

The Solus Project are tutorials based on the content of Solus.

Work on Solus started in July 2013, and we have a team of about 4 to 5 people working on this off and on. The game is the brainchild of Hourences, who previously designed and created the Unreal Engine 3 game The Ball.

  

### Solus Example Project

We stripped down Solus to the essentials and wrapped it up in a Solus Example project, which I am releasing for free.

This free project contains:

*   My folder structure and naming conventions
*   Some all purpose meshes and textures.
*   Over a dozen of my Light IES Textures
*   A Material Function Library with 20′ish material setups I use often.
*   Some of my material setups
*   My entire day and night alien sky system (!) – No weather is included in it though.
*   The Blueprints for the player and various other key parts.
*   Some of my sounds, effects, and so on.

### Overview Videos

Four free videos are available online that give an overview on how we approached building the game and setting everything up, with most of the focus on Blueprint scripting. Shows just how far you can go, and what kind of tips and tricks are possible.

### In-depth Videos

*   **The Solus Project – Level Building Introduction Preview – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yuz7\_G69Rs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yuz7_G69Rs)**

Using the modular and easy to use modular environment assets from Solus, this video introduces you to everything you need to know to build basic environments in Unreal Engine 4. Besides covering how to build environments using modular meshes, the video also goes over how to create a landscape, apply foliage, how to best apply the UE4 reflection system, lighting and its performance considerations, and how to keep track and organize your levels.

*   **The Solus Project – Blueprint Introduction Preview – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXd\_qW6dtWw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXd_qW6dtWw)**

Starting from the basics, and building upon the free Solus Example project, this beginners video starts off by talking you through creating a door for Solus. First one that is set up in the level, then one that is set up in a separate Blueprint. Following that you will be building a pressure plate to control the door, and following that the video covers how to build a basic item system. Detecting, highlighting, and picking up rocks in the world, and place them on the pressure plate to keep the door open permanently.

*   **The Solus Project – Blueprint Continued 1 Preview – [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4\_dCTpVEWoA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_dCTpVEWoA)**

Continues upon the Blueprint Introduction video. Using the same content and the Blueprint scripts set up in that introduction video, this video steps it up a couple of notches. This advanced video dives deeper into Blueprint and touches on topics such as Macros, Functions, Arrays, and complex networks.

The eventual outcome of this video is having a player who can take damage, die, respawn, enable checkpoints, pick up and switch between multiple items, and who can combine a pipe with branches and fire to create a torch.
