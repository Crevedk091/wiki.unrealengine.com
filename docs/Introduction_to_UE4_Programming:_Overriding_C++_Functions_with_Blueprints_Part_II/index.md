**Description:**

In this video, we'll set up our battery's gameplay behavior. We'll work with our BlueprintNativeEvent and include the C++-coded parent behavior, and alter the lightning bolt we imported before so that it will follow the character and the battery around the level. We'll also test all of the behavior we've set up in C++ and Blueprints so far!

**Note:**

It's mentioned really quickly, but in case you missed it like I did, you must be pressing the "E" key near a battery to trigger the "CollectBatteries()" method in C++. Walking up to a battery doesn't automatically trigger a pickup event.
