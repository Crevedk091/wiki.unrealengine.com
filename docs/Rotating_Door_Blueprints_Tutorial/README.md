Approved for Versions:4.6.1

  
This tutorial will take you through step by step in creating your own blueprints in the Unreal Engine 4.

You will learn how to create a a rotating door which behaves like a regular door (only swinging open one way), and then we will adapt the blueprints to make the door swing open, away from the player, no matter which side of the door they are on.

► Attention! For this blueprint tutorial, you will need a static mesh of a door which has a rotation point placed on it's edge. You may need to use a 3D modelling program (such as Blender, which is free!) to make this happen. ◄
