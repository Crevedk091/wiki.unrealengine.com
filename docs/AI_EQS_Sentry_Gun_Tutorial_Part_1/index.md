AI EQS Sentry Gun Tutorial Part 1
=================================

AI EQS Sentry Gun Tutorial Part One - In this tutorial series we'll be setting up a sentry gun to use the EQS system. EQS stands for "environment query system" and is currently experimental in 4.6.1 but provides the ability for AI agents to evaluate their surroundings in a performance friendly manner. It allows you to "score" various environmental factors and pick the highest (or lowest) rated value for decision making. In this case, we set up an EQS Query which allows the sentry gun to determine the closest target of a specific object type to fire at.
