**DEVELOPMENT**

Pneuma was developed by a team of six 21 year olds in an astonishing 6 months. Deco Digital and Bevel Studios teamed up after discovering a lack of jobs in industry and decided to take a leap at setting up their own studio. The team would work in a tiny closet of an office from 9AM - 5PM then from 7PM - 4AM they would turn to their night jobs to pay their rent. 6 months of development and 3 months of porting work lead up to the official release day on February 27th 2015. Exact figures are not published but the overall reception was positive with the game receiving 4/5 stars on the Xbox Store. The team has stayed together and has began work on their new title.
