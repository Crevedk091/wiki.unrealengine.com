**Description:**

We’ll set up gameplay rules in our GameMode in this video, including the power drain on our character, and adding a PlayState variable to be able to tell if we are playing or the game is over. One topic we’ll cover here is how to set variables as private, and then define public functions to allow other classes to alter those variables safely.
