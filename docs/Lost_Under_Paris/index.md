**Summary**

“Lost Under Paris” is a first person, 3D exploration and survival Indie Horror game, built on the Unreal 4 Engine. It showcases the real life Catacombs situated right beneath the city of Paris. It is idealized through real video content found of an “amateur cave explorer” making his way through the catacombs until the point he realises he may have lost his way. This in turn results in the man sprinting through the catacombs, extremely pretified, eventually dropping his camcorder on the ground, and running ahead into the distance. This man was never found.
