Overview
--------

The Portals plugin is a lightweight rendering / actor plugin which interfaces easily with an existing game to safely manage 'Portals' that any player can travel through, to instantly appear in another location in the world.

The portal Renderer is compatible with VR and can be tuned for completely seamless transitions. All core functionality is handled by C++, and the end user can easily interface their existing classes.
