Overview
--------

This tutorial covers how to create a distance based Tessellation being driven by 6 changable parameters.  
  

Setup
-----

Before we can start you should have a basic knowledge of the Material Editor being used within the Unreal Engine 4. Also recommended but not mandatory is an understanding what Tessellation is especially and what it does and how it's being used. If you're not sure check out other tutorials before going ahead or simply check the "Additional Tutorials" chapter.  
  

Tutorial
--------

Due to the fact that it's a complicated Material function I created a video tutorial that offers a step by step explanation.  
  

Material Composition
--------------------

Even though I'd still suggest watching the tutorial, here is an image of the final material.

Distance Based Tessellation Material

  
To understand what the Param Values mean here is a screen illustrating the situation.

Distance Based Tessellation Explanation

  
Minimal Distance = Distance from OBJECT to A, "Max Height" and "Iterations" with the predefined value  
Maximal Distance = Distance from A to B, at B "Max Height" and "Iterations" value is 0, transitioning/fading from A to B
