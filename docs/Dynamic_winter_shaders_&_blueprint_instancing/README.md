Hello!  

I have uploaded some documentation that will allow you to create a basic frost/snow shader and how to instance this effect over all your meshes.  

The documentation is in 2 parts and will cover:  

*   How to create a basic layered frost material
*   How to hook this up to blueprint to make it dynamic
*   How to change this to look more like falling snow
*   How we can use a single variable to effect all instances of our winter simulation on all meshes
*   How we can switch out material functions inside our master material

  
Please follow the links to the video introductions and documentation page:

Enjoy!
