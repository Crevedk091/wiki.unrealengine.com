Wes Bunn - Epic Games

**Description:**

In this video we do a little bit of prep-work by creating some assets that will be used with the Inventory System including some thumbnail images that will be used for our pickups, we also add some conditional states for our player character and create some Blueprints to hold our pickup data and to communicate with our Inventory and Pickup Blueprints.
