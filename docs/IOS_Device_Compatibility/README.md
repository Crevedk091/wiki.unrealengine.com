IOS Device Compatibility
========================

This page is a place for the community to view and provide data on iOS devices that have run UE4. Please be sure to include the version of iOS for your device.

Legend:  

**LDR** (TappyChicken) - Low Dynamic Range. The highest performance tier supported in UE4 and is recommended for games that do not require lighting or postprocessing features  
**Basic Lighting** (StrategyGame) - Leverages static lighting and fully rough Materials to create levels with interesting lighting while maximizing performance to reach a broader range of mobile devices  
**Full HDR w/ Sun** (SunTemple) - This tier is the same as the 'Full HDR' tier and has the same advantages and recommendations except that a single directional light is rendered at much higher quality

 For detailed information on the Rendering Features in the table, see our [Performance Guidelines for Mobile Devices](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Platforms/Mobile/Performance/index.html) page.

**Supported** - Device passed basic compatibility testing and is expected to work, barring minor issues that may need to be fixed for certain features, or low performance  
**Expected** - Device was not fully tested but the hardware is expected to be supported, barring any unique software/driver implementation
