This tutorial will take you through step by step in creating your own blueprints in the Unreal Engine 4.

You will learn how to create a door blueprint that will open and close on activation, and a switch blueprint that will be used to activate the door. Once done, you may drag and drop as many of these blueprints into your level as you wish, and no addition visual script will be necessary.

The principles learnt in this video can be applied to other situations where you want to have interaction with one blueprint affecting another blueprint.
