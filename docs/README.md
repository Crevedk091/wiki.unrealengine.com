# Hello wiki.unrealengine.com

This site was pulled from the internet archives and then processed to recreate the text parts of the wiki.

- Is it great?  Hell no.
- Is it good? Not really.
- Is it a place you can copy the old text of your wiki articles?  Yes.  Probably.

The images didn't make it through the internet archive, and some article titles didn't make it for having non-websafe characters in their titles.  See the [repo](https://github.com/MichaelJCole/wiki.unrealengine.com) for details on how I got them.

The site was built in a fury using [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/#how-it-works) in about 10 hours of work from concept to this page.
