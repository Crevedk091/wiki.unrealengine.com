Overview
--------

ODIN Tracker is a UE4 Plugin that greatly increases workflow efficiency in-editor when it comes to using both Source Control and Project Management Software/Services i.e. a tool that does the job quickly and hopefully annoyance-free as to allow an artist, designer or other to get back to what he/she does best, which is to create magic ;) ​

After all, Both you and they don’t really want to be paid to fiddle around with Source Control and Project Management Software/Services any longer than is absolutely necessary… ​

Product Summary
---------------

The ODIN Tracker UE4 Plugin has the following sub-modules:

*   Task Tracker (JIRA, GitHub, Trello, etc.)
*   Capture Tool (Image/GIF/Video + entire Blueprint capture and post-capture editing tools).
*   Time Tracker (Tracker/Logger + Timesheets with upload to JIRA/Other).
*   Settings + Custom Templates and Workflow Builder Back-End.

​

We have plans for both an Offline Mode which will be partially completed in the 1.0 release with the remaining features being added in 1.1 through to 2.x and features to support running the plugin at run-time within your game for QA and Alpha/Beta Testers to have access to with included granular permission settings to manage QA, Private, and Public Alpha/Beta Tester submission access rights. ​

We are also looking at supporting a 3D Space Issue/Task placement with the UE4 Editor Viewport that would include:

*   Sign/Marker with text (In-Viewport + Runtime).
*   Area/Volume Marker (In-Viewport + Editor PanelTab + Runtime) e.g. build house/car park/shopping mall within this grid space.
*   Tag to object (In-Viewport + Editor PanelTab) e.g. “This tagged \[ISSUE-KEY\] mesh has a broken collision volume.”

​

ETA on this feature is uncertain at this stage but some elements of this feature set will most likely make their way into somewhere between 1.0 through to 2.0

  

Estimated Release Date
----------------------

*   Closed-Alpha (Invite Only) = February / March
*   Closed-Beta (Invite Only) = TBD
*   Open-Beta Phase 1 (Submitted to UE4 Marketplace) = TBD
*   Open-Beta Phase 2 (1st Public Bugfix Release) = TBD
*   GA Release (Launch Date) = TBD

​

Estimated Price
---------------

*   Basic Functionality = FREE
*   Advanced Functionality = $39.95 to $59.95 USD per-user (one-time payment for all updates included in the 1.x release)
*   Enterprise Functionality = TBD
*   Premium Support = TBD

  
**NOTE:** We are considering to offer a modular pricing model which will allow the end-user to purchase selected advanced functionality of ODIN Tracker without having to purchase the lot for $39.95 to $59.95 USD.

For example, end-users may only wish to purchase the advanced functionality for the ODIN Tasks & Capture modules but have no need for the ODIN Time or QA modules.
