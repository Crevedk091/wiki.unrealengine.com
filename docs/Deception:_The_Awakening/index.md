Overview
========

Deception: The Awakening is a psychological horror game currently being developed by Initial Game Studios.

Gameplay
========

In Deception: The Awakening, you portray Alexander Jones - a fairly destitute, middle-aged father of one - not but two months back, you tragically lost your young daughter, Amelia Jones, in a house fire. As you sit day after day visiting her at the graveyard in which she lay, you can't help but notice a dark figure lingering in the distant house to the north. Even in the darkness of the night your mournful, dolorous eyes can still make out the blood-chilling figure over-watching your every move. No matter what you do, you simply cannot push the image out of your head.

Development
===========

### Background

In July 2013, Initial Game Studios began a 'concept phase' of two or three months prior to the beginning of development. These few months were used for developers and level designers to familiarize themselves with Unreal Engine 3/UDK, and for artists and scriptwriters to begin working on concepts. Development was started in September 2013, under the name 'Project: Deception' - this was the code-name for Deception: The Awakening until February 2014 when Deception: The Awakening became the conventional name for the game.

### Unreal Engine 4

In late July 2014, Initial Game Studios began to port over Deception: The Awakening from Unreal Development Kit to the newly released Unreal Engine 4. In early August 2014, porting to Unreal Engine 4 was completed and normal development began to take place again.
