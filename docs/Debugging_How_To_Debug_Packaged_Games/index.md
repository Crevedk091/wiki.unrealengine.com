Dear Community,

In this wiki I explain how it is that you can debug packaged games, both by having the **debug symbols/files available** for the UE4 crash reporter, and via **attach to process** using Visual Studio!

Debug Symbols For Crash Reporter
--------------------------------

If you're reading this you probably have gotten a crash in your packaged game and simply been told that you do not have debugging symbols enabled/available to assist further with figuring out what happened.

To package the game so that debugging symbols are included, check out this pic!

You can get here from **Package Project -> Packaging Settings** or **Project Settings -> Packaging Settings**

Debugging With Visual Studio
----------------------------

To debug a packaged game via Visual Studio:

1\. In visual studio, compile the game for DebugGame Win32/Win64

2\. After packaging, add all of the DebugGame files you find in your Binaries folder to your packaged Binaries folder, in Win32/Win64 directory.

3\. **Run the DebugGame executable instead of the regular one.**

4\. After your game starts, open visual studio, and press CTRL + ALT + P

5\. Find your game in the process list and select it.

6\. Now debugger symbols will load and you have full debugging help for your game!

You can now rest easy, your debugging powers in packaged games have just exponentially increased!
