This source attribution line is only needed if the majority of this tutorial has been taken from an external site, such as [someone's blog](http://www.allarsblog.com).

This tutorial serves as a self-referencing guide on how to properly format a tutorial for this Wiki. View this page's source and copy the layout for your own tutorial.

This tutorial is aimed at beginners who have a small understanding of MediaWiki's formatting. A great resource for MediaWiki formatting to use while following along can be found on [MediaWiki's Formatting Page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting)

Requirements
------------

You must have a registered account at [http://www.unrealengine.com](http://www.unrealengine.com) to create Wiki pages.

Getting Started
---------------

### Creating The Page

The first step is to create the page for your new tutorial. The easiest way to do that is to first come up with a name for your page and convert it to a URL friendly format. The name of this tutorial is "Wiki Tutorial Template". To convert it to a URL friendly name, simply replace all spaces with underscores. An underscore is this character here: \_

If you accidentally used a bad URL, go ahead and create the page anyway. Once the page is created, view the source and at the top right of the page you will be given the option to Move it to a better fitting URL which will give it a new name.

### Using This Template

To get the layout of your new tutorial done quickly, simply [Edit this page](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/index.php?title=Wiki_Tutorial_Template&action=edit) and copy all of this page's content to your new page.

### Embedding Images In Your Tutorial

Images are a great way to simplify tutorials. Sometimes a simple screen capture of a dialog box or blueprint graph can be invaluable. To embed an image, simply create a link to a file of a name of your choosing and save your page. View the source for the above paragraph as an example on how to create this link. Once your page is saved, your link will appear as blue clickable text.

1.  Clicking this link will prompt you to upload your file.
2.  Choose your image to upload

3.  Click Upload Image at the bottom!

### Create More Sections As Needed

You might not need many sections to convey your tutorial. 'Big Steps' such as 'Getting Started' should begin with a level 2 heading, or a 'double equal sign'. 'Small Steps' should begin with a level 3 heading, or a 'triple equal sign'. If you need a large amount of 'Big Steps', it may be worth creating a series of smaller tutorials instead. Please use Camel Case (Capitalize every word) for these headings. Never create a level 1 heading, or a 'single equal sign', as this conflicts with the page title.

As you can see at the top of this post, using proper headings will result in a nicely generated Table of Contents.

Conclusion
----------

After the above steps, you should now have a beautifully created Wiki Tutorial for the Unreal Engine 4 Wiki! Make sure you proofread it a few times. [http://www.polishmywriting.com/](http://www.polishmywriting.com/) is a great free way to have a machine do so, but the best proofreading of a new tutorial is done by yourself.
