Dear Community

In this video tutorial series I walk you through my entire development process for making a UMG move-able window that works with drag-click, and can contain any content you want!

I made an entirely customizeable window system that you can port into your own project by downloading the project I am sharing with you in this video series!

### Rama's UMG Moveable Window

1\. Can be drag-clicked and repositioned anywhere on the screen

2\. Can contain any content you want

3\. Can be easily initialized with window dimensions as well as content with just 1 node.

Enjoy!
