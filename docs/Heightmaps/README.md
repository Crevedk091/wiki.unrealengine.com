Heightmaps can be imported into UE4 in either PNG or RAW formats. The technical details of these formats are described [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Landscape/Creation/index.html#heightmapformat).

Heightmaps can be created in external terrain-generation software and image-editing software.

Terrain Generation Software
---------------------------

*   [TerreSculptor](http://www.lilchips.com/hmesalpha.htm)
*   [World Machine](http://www.world-machine.com/)
*   [GeoControl](http://www.cajomi.de/GeoControl/geocontrol2_features.htm)

  

Image editors capable of editing and/or creating heightmaps
-----------------------------------------------------------

*   [Krita](http://krita.org/index.php)
*   [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

[The Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) will **not** edit or create acceptable heightmaps until version 3.0 is released. Heightmaps use a 16-bit grayscale colorspace to provide smooth gradations of terrain. The Gimp uses an 8-bit color space. While UE4 will allow you to import such a file, the results are unacceptably jagged and blocky.
