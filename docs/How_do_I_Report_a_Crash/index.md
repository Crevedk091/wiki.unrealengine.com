How do I Report a Crash
=======================

When reporting a crash, please make a post on the [Bug Reports section of the AnswerHub](https://answers.unrealengine.com/spaces/11/bugs-and-crashes.html), and follow the guidelines below to help us reproduce the crash on our end:

*   Let us know what version of the editor you are using, whether you are using the Github build or launcher build, and whether your project is a C++ project or blueprint project
*   If possible, try to reproduce the crash in a clean, blank project with no additional content or the bare minimum needed to cause the crash
*   Include the crash logs which can be found by going to **\\UnrealProjects\\PROJECTNAME\\saved\\logs\\**. Include both the .LOG and .DMP files.
*   When the crash submission window appears, it lists a MachineID and sometimes an EpicID, please copy these (along with the Callstack) and paste them. This will allow Epic to locate the submitted crash info.
*   Specify the operating system or platform which the crash occurs on (Windows, Mac, mobile device, etc.)
*   If you are on Windows and the crash is unique to your system or may be hardware related, please include your system DxDiag report as an attachment.
*   If you are on a Mac, please provide system information instead of DxDiag (this can be found by going to the Apple Menu>About this Mac>More Info).
    *   The info you will need is: Video card, RAM, Processor, and any other information you feel is relevant to the crash.

### With Reproduction Steps

*   Provide any reproduction steps that will help us to accurately reproduce the crash. Please list the steps in order, and be as detailed as possible.
*   Try testing your own reproduction steps on a new empty project. Does it still occur? If not, identify what is unique about your project and let Epic know.
*   If Epic support staff and engineers are not able to reproduce the crash internally, then we are less likely to be able to fix it. Although occasionally the logs and crash dumps do help.

### Without Reproduction Steps

*   If you do not have reproduction steps which we can follow on a new project, then please send us any assets involved which can make the crash occur. Make sure these assets aren't confidential, and you are okay with sharing them publicly.
*   At minimum, please include the files mentioned above. Please be aware that we cannot guarantee a fix for a crash which we are not able to reproduce.
