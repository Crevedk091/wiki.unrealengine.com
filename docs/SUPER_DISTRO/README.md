Overview

CONQUER THE BATTLEFIELD WITH SUPER-POWERED ABILITIES AND THE SKILL OF YOUR HOARDING!

"SUPER DISTRO" is a hard-as-nails (Seriously, Who comes up with these idioms?) 2D platformer in the style of retro games such as Megaman, Super Mario Bros 2: The Lost Levels and other such rage-inducing classics. Taking "Difficult gameplay" to a whole new level - SUPER DISTRO is not for the faint-of-heart. You will die again and again. The weak need not apply - Only those who are determined to overcome impossible odds will find victory here and those are the rules of the land in SUPER DISTRO.

In the words of a certain sour-tasting character from a popular television show: "We've have it all!"

"SUPER DISTRO" is hopefully unlike anything you've ever played before (We promise that's a good thing!) - Taking familiar staples of excellent games of yesteryear and throwing bucketloads of creativity and innovation (And wall-punching difficulty!) on top; You'll be delighted with the result! Everything has been loving handcrafted by a single guy (With a little help from his friends!) to make sure SUPER DISTRO a stupidly enjoyable, Yet rage-inducing experience.
