How to Hide OS Mouse Cursor Anytime, Anywhere
=============================================

Dear Community,

Here is how you can absolutely guaranteed hide the OS mouse cursor if you see it while in-game and want it to not be visible

I put this into a static function library format for your convenience.

//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//  Show/Hide OS Mouse Cursor
//~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
static FORCEINLINE void SetOSCursorVisible(bool MakeVisible)
{
	FSlateApplication::Get().GetPlatformApplication()\-\>Cursor\-\>Show(MakeVisible);
}

Enjoy!

PS: if you are wondering why this is a page unto itself its because it took me about a year to finally learn how to do this, more obvious methods in the codebase were not workingÂ :)
