Overview
========

**VaOcean** is the _ocean surface simulation plugin_ for Unreal Engine 4.

The plugin includes:

*   Component that renders displacement and gradient (normal) maps in real time
*   Sample content, including water shader and grid meshes to be used on scene
*   Set of global shaders that perform FFT calculation and other tech stuff on GPU

Plugin is actively used in [SeaCraft](http://seacraft.sc) project development.

Current version: **0.4 Alpha 6 - Hotfix 1**

Plugin access
-------------

Plugin is avaible under MIT open-source license, you can download it here (please read [installation notes](https://github.com/ufna/VaOcean#installation), _unusual step required_). Source code is available on Github: [https://github.com/ufna/VaOcean](https://github.com/ufna/VaOcean)

Preview videos:

  

*   Open ocean

*   Grid patch

*   Wireframe

Plugin is in alpha stage now, and I'm going to add and improve a lot of things next.

Additional notes
----------------

Today plugin is available only on Windows platform due to current limitations of OpenGL implementation used by the engine. It will be fixed once we'll be able to use structured buffers with OpenGL.
