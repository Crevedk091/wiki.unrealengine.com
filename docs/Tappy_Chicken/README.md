Gameplay
--------

The chicken automatically begins the game by moving forward and falling. Tapping or clicking the screen will cause the chicken to flap, so that it will not hit the ground and die. Pipes will begin spawning in the way of the chickens flight. The player has to then time their taps so that the chicken does not hit the pipes, but instead flies through the gap.

iOS should be around 24 MB if the same optimizations were applied
