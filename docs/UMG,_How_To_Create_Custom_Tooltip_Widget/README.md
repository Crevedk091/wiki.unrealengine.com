In this video tutorial, I show you how you can make your own custom UMG tooltip that will appear with any tooltip text you want, for any individual component of your UMG widgets.

You can use any font, any size, and even include images if you want to!

Multi-line Tooltips Supported!
------------------------------

Please note that during this video I actually took my method a step further, customizing the approach used for single or multiline tooltips.

For single line tooltips the length is truncated to just the right size, and for multi-line tooltips I show you how you can set the height to be just right, while also wrapping the text to your desired max bounds!

Conclusion
----------

Using what I show you in this video wiki you can easily make stylized UMG tooltips for your game!

Enjoy!
