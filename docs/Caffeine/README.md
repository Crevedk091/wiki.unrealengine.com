Summary
=======

Caffeine is a first person adventure horror game currently in development by indie developer Dylan Browne. The player awakens as a young child aboard a seemingly empty space station designed to mine the minerals required to create synthetic caffeine. Caffeine is inspired heavily by Alien, F.E.A.R and Condemned: Criminal Origins.

Gameplay
========

Caffeine is at it's heart a non-linear exploratory adventure game with horror elements, in addition there are simple environmental puzzles and a hefty amount of background lore scattered around the environment.

Development
===========

### Origins

Caffeine began development as a level designed to demonstrate some modular components within UDK (Unreal Engine 3). Eventually a trailer was released and the positive reception pushed Dylan Browne to create a game with the look and feel of the test environment.

### Unreal Engine 4

With the launch of Unreal Engine 4, Caffeine was ported over to the new engine in around four weeks and an early pre-alpha demo was released.
