**Description:**

In this video, we will show you how to merge your Montage animation into the existing AnimGraph with Slot Nodes and Branch Points.

**Notes:**

When adding the Slot node, its the one under Blend. Use the details tab for the node to update the Slot Name to whatever you set in your Animation Montage.

Do not forget to set the new "Montage" setting when adding the two "Montage Set Next Section" function nodes.
