Introduction to UE4 Programming - 5 - Empowering the Character
==============================================================

  

**Author:**

**Description:**

In this video, we’ll set up a power level for our character. We’re going to make the character’s speed dependent on his power level, and then also add a new sphere component and some functions so the character can collect the batteries. We’ll also set up input bindings for our CollectBatteries function.
