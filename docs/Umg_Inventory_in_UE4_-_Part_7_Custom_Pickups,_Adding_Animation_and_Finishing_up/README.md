Umg Inventory in UE4 - Part 7 Custom Pickups, Adding Animation and Finishing up

**Description:**

The final video in this series does a little bit of cleaning up and shows how you can customize your pickups so that you can edit them on the fly from the Details panel, which makes creating different pickups a snap. We also take a look at Animation in UMG so that our Inventory Menu flies in or out when it is called or released. We also play in the editor to make sure that everything is working as intended.
