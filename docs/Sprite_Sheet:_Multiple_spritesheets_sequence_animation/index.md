Overview
--------

This is a basic tutorial showing how to create a material in UE4, multiple sprite sheets textures with an image sequence on it. During the video tutorial the author of the video describes a constant number that hes not sure what it has to to do with the number within the time function of the blueprint of rows or columns in the sprite sheet. The Number has to do with the speed at which the Flipbook node plays back your image sequence. Info Sourced from Ryan Shays book Master the art of unreal engine 4 blueprints book 1 of 3.
