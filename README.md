# Welcome to the internet archive dump of the wiki.unrealengine.com website.

For the articles, see below.

### About this Site

- Is this site awesome?  Hell no.
- Is this site a replacement?  Nope.  A lot didn't make it.  A lot did.
- Can you copy the text from your wiki's and start over?  Yes.

Please note this site was taken offline for security reason, so please handle the "original" folder in the [git repo](https://github.com/MichaelJCole/wiki.unrealengine.com) appropriately.

### How this data was collected

The Internet Archive has a wayback machine:

```
https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://wiki.unrealengine.com/*
```

The Wayback-machine-downloader has a Docker image:

```
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD/websites:/websites hartator/wayback-machine-downloader https://wiki.unrealengine.com/ 
```

Then a bunch of scripts and some [VuePress](https://snipcart.com/blog/choose-best-static-site-generator) and viola!  Mission accomplished.  Gitbook is no longer in active development after a pivot to SaaS.

### How can I help?

PR's welcome.  If you have the images, let's add them to the folders even if not to the VuePress site.
