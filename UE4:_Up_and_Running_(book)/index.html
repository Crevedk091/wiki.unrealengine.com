I'm thinking it shouldn't cover C++ or some of the very advanced parts of Blueprints, but act as a beginner's guide to starting work with UE4.</p> <p>The main reason for wanting to start this book was to have an easily laid-out guide that readers can skip through to suit their skill level, and also contribute if they feel something is lacking or if something could have been written better.</p> <p>Hopefully with the support and help from the community it'll grow into a great guide for newcomers to get started.</p> <h2 id="contributing"><a href="#contributing" class="header-anchor">#</a> Contributing</h2> <p>You're completely free to edit the contents of this page however you see fit, and I encourage you to do just that. But for any major changes, I think it'd be a good idea to utilize the Talk pages to discuss changes with any other contributors to avoid stepping on toes or writing up content that someone else might already be working on.</p> <h2 id="table-of-contents"><a href="#table-of-contents" class="header-anchor">#</a> Table of Contents</h2> <p>This is just a very basic table of contents that I thought would be good starting grounds to cover for the book. It's by no means set in stone. Most of it takes inspiration from books in the same area.</p> <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>This chapter could spend a little time explaining the company behind the product, for people who are completely new to the world of Unreal and Epic. It could also be used to explain who would best benefit from this book.</p> <ul><li>Who are Epic Games?</li> <li>Who is this book for?</li></ul> <p><strong>Chapter 1: Introducing Unreal Engine 4</strong></p> <p>This chapter could explain how to download the UE4 Launcher and get started running the editor. It could also explain navigating the editor and run through the very basics of the editor interface, just enough to get started.</p> <ul><li>What is UE4?</li> <li>What can UE4 be used for?</li> <li>UE4 Features
<ul><li>UE4 Editor</li> <li>Blueprints</li></ul></li> <li>Downloading and installing the UE4 launcher</li></ul> <p><strong>Chapter 2: Our First Project</strong></p> <p>This chapter could walk the reader through creating their first level. It could touch on Blueprints, but it might be better to leave that to a later chapter and just use this chapter to get them acquainted with the editor and the viewport.</p> <p><strong>Chapter 3: Blueprints</strong></p> <p>This chapter could briefly explain what Blueprints are and how they can be used. It could also add interactivity to the level created in Chapter 1.</p> <ul><li>What are Blueprints?</li> <li>Using Blueprints</li></ul> <p><strong>Appendix A: UE4 Cookbook</strong></p> <p>This chapter could list common tasks by subject (such as creating luminescent materials) and explain in short and how they can be achieved. This section could pretty much list out a lot of the existing tutorials and guides out there, since there's quite a lot of good ones already.</p> <p>Retrieved from &quot;<a href="https://wiki.unrealengine.com/index.php?title=UE4:_Up_and_Running_(book)&amp;oldid=3110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wiki.unrealengine.com/index.php?title=UE4:_Up_and_Running_(book)&amp;oldid=3110<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>&quot;</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
