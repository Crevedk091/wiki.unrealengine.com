Even the best model rendered with poor shadow resolution and not taking advantage of the right post process settings will look poor. In the Unreal Engine, it means digging in to our robust lighting, reflection and post process settings. This Troubleshooting guide attempts to cover some of the more common problems that people come across when they first dig into the lighting and rendering systems. This guide is by no means meant to be completely comprehensive but a living document as the engine changes so too can we add and alter advice presented here. The guide is meant to be a great first step for artist trying to get the most out of the engine's rendering system.</p> <p><strong>Common Lighting Documentation pages for reference:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/Lightmass/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lightmass Global Illumination</strong><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p><a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Resources/ContentExamples/Lighting/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lighting Basics</strong><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p><a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lighting the Environment</strong><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p><a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Resources/ContentExamples/Lighting/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lighting Content Examples</strong><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p><a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Platforms/Mobile/Lighting/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Lighting for Mobile Platforms</strong><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p><a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Rendering &amp; Graphics</strong><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <h2 id="general-lighting"><a href="#general-lighting" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>General Lighting</strong></h2> <p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <h3 id="why-are-my-shadows-black"><a href="#why-are-my-shadows-black" class="header-anchor">#</a> Why Are My Shadows Black?</h3> <p>In lighting terms, deep black shadows usually mean you have no fill light.

However, when it’s imported into Unreal Engine 4 it’s messed up!</p> <p>So, what gives, because this surely cannot be right?!</p> <p>This is actually 100% normal (pun intended). Even though the plane looks good the back face is not being rendered just like the closest faces of our tube mesh.</p> <p><a href="/index.php?title=File:3_Wireframe.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/9/97/3_Wireframe.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Wireframe of Created Assets in UE4</p> <p>When you create your geometry in your modeling program by default the software has set it so that you can see both sides of your geometry.</p> <p>In UE4 the back face of a polygon is automatically culled to save on performance because every little bit helps! It’s not always necessary to have extra polygons or render sides that may not be needed, otherwise, there would be extra draw calls that could slow down your performance. with a few instances, this probably wouldn’t matter much, but when you’re developing for specific platforms or have a lot going on every draw call starts to matter.</p> <p>To also understand why we can only see one side we can open our mesh in the static mesh editor and tick the toolbar option for “Normals.” You will see Green lines that point in the direction the face of the polygon is directed. In the image below for our tube asset, we can see that the faces where it’s invisible have the lines going towards the center of the mesh. This is the direction that the visible face can be seen.</p> <p><a href="/index.php?title=File:4_SMEditor_Normals.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/a/af/4_SMEditor_Normals.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Static Mesh Editor</p> <p><em><strong>Pro Tip:</strong></em> While in UE4 if you have any meshes that have what appears to be invisible geometry or missing faces you can check the normals here before fixing the issue in your modeling software.</p> <p>Now that we have all the boring stuff out of the way we can get right to fixing our invisible faces with some checkboxes and Materials.</p> <p>1. <strong>(STATIC ONLY)Light as if Two-Sided</strong></p> <ul><li><p>Enabled this option via the details panel for the selected asset in the Level Viewport.</p></li> <li><p>With this option selected when lights are built lightmass will calculate that geometry into its bake.

Unreal Engine 4 does a good job of trying to optimize things so that you don’t have to worry about it so much. The problem is sometimes it gets carried away and can cause things like this to happen that may not be obvious how to fix.</p> <ul><li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:1.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/4/4a/1.png/642px-1.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>This is what we want, Close to Camera</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:4.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/0/09/4.png/642px-4.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>At a Distance from Camera</p></li></ul> <p>So, what gives?!</p> <p>To explain this we need to discuss that awesome optimizing the engine does for you. The engine uses scene depth to determine what should be visible and what shouldn't be visible for rendering. Since we have a point light here that shoots light throughout it’s set radius when the mesh is beyond its bounds it will be occluded or no longer rendered. This causes the issue that we’re seeing with our light starting to cast in all directions.</p> <p>You can see from this image that as the camera is further away the occlusion of parts of the mesh start to halo around the outer edge until the light is free to cast in all directions.</p> <ul><li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:WallOcclusion.gif"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/6/68/WallOcclusion.gif" alt=""></a></p> <p>Mesh Light Occlusion</p></li></ul> <p>You may notice that if you select the mesh when far away that the light returns to normal. This is expected as you have just selected the mesh and it is now focused.</p> <p><a href="/index.php?title=File:Detailspanel.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/e/e6/Detailspanel.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Object Bounds, Details Panel, Rendering Tab</p> <p>To keep the mesh from being occluded you’ll need to select the mesh and go to the details panel. Here you can search or scroll for the “Bounds Scale” (Located under the Tab for Rendering.)</p> <p>The default value is set to 1.0. When increasing this scale be sure to only use incremental small numbers. Using a value of 2.0 doubles what the distance was set to which can be overkill. Try increasing by smaller incremental values. (ie. 1.1, 1.2) There is no need in pushing to have more than you need as this can impact performance and shadow quality.</p> <p>You can visualize your meshes bounds by going to the viewport &gt; Show &gt; Advanced &gt; Bounds</p> <p>You will see something like this:</p> <p><a href="/index.php?title=File:Bounds.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/8/81/Bounds.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Object Bounds Visualized</p> <p>Additional notes:</p> <p>If you’re having issues with your mesh occluding, but don’t want to increase the bounds scale due to performance concerns you can try using a Spotlight. Since this only casts light in a single direction you won’t notice the light of a point light casting in all directions when the mesh is occluded. This works well for situations similar to what has been demonstrated, but testing may need to be done on your part to get things just right.</p> <p>Alternatively, you could forego a fully movable/dynamic light and use a stationary light that bakes a lightmap texture, which can also save on performance by having zero overhead during runtime for rendering shadow information. _________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <h2 id="static-lighting"><a href="#static-lighting" class="header-anchor">#</a> <strong>Static Lighting</strong></h2> <hr> <h3 id="lightmap-resolution-shadow-quality"><a href="#lightmap-resolution-shadow-quality" class="header-anchor">#</a> Lightmap Resolution / Shadow Quality</h3> <p>Every project has its own unique art direction and goals, so this section is meant to present common concepts and give you a foundation to begin achieving what you want from your static lighting.

This is an unfortunate side-effect of how static indirect lighting is handled at the moment and doesn’t have an easy way to fix. This can hopefully be made better in the future.</p> <p>Here’s the breakdown of the issue, if you’re not familiar.</p> <ul><li>Light hits a surface and then that light is bounced on the surrounding surfaces. This type of bounce light is referred to as Indirect Lighting. Some surfaces will be directly lit as well while still receiving some bounce, like the Wall that is partly lit fully and has some indirect lighting with the shading issue in the shadowed corner.</li></ul> <p><a href="/index.php?title=File:LightBounce.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/9/95/LightBounce.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Light Bounce Example</p> <ul><li>If the surfaces receiving the indirect lighting are flat planar surfaces they generated this disparity in shading between them like this:</li></ul> <p><a href="/index.php?title=File:Shading.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/6/6d/Shading.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Indirect Lighting Artifact</p> <p>What’s happening here is that each of these static meshes are sent to the CPU to be processed in the order they are received and on different CPU threads. This simply means that while each one has their lighting built by lightmass the others don’t know what the shading for the one before it would look like to reference the edges to make sure they match up. This leads to slight shading differences between each planar surface.</p> <p>So, by now, you’re wondering “What can I do about this?!”, right?</p> <p>In the World Settings under the section for Lightmass you can adjust some of the settings here to get better results.</p> <ul><li>Indirect Lighting Quality can be set to 2 or higher.</li> <li>Indirect Lighting Smoothness can be set to usually a range of .65-.75. The lower the value here is though the more artifacts you can run into that make the lightmap look like it has blotchiness to it.</li> <li>(Recommended only for Advanced Users!!) Static Lighting Level Scale can be adjusted to a lower value to get better blending as well. But this changes the scale of how lighting is calculated for the entire level. This will increase build times significantly if the value is lowered but will give you better results. This is commonly used by those within the Architectural Visualization field and not by those developing games unless they have a specific reason and understand the choice.</li></ul> <p>When you adjust the quality of indirect lighting it’s always a good idea to lower the lighting smoothness to get better results. This helps blend better between these surfaces, but it doesn’t necessarily help remove the issue completely and can have other side-effects as well. You should really test it in project or a test map to fully understand what you’re adjusting here and why.</p> <p>There is also some steps you can take to reduce how noticeable this artifact is and steps you can take with the design of your project.</p> <ul><li>Try not to over-modularize your levels! This is important. You may think that making a moderately sized wall into nice smaller concise pieces that you can pack together like Lego’s is the best thing ever, but you run the risk of this shading difference happening, and you now have many more actors that add to draw calls and checks for the visibility states of these. It’s best to have have a single wall when it makes sense rather than many small pieces. You get reduced draw calls and less issues that can occur with lighting.</li> <li>You can simply use other geometry to better hide these pieces where there would be seams, like columns or adjoining walls, or wall molding.</li></ul> <p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <h3 id="what-is-this-overlapping-uv-error-non-sense-when-i-build-lighting"><a href="#what-is-this-overlapping-uv-error-non-sense-when-i-build-lighting" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is this “Overlapping UV error” non-sense when I build lighting?</h3> <p>When using static or stationary lighting it is imperative to use two UVs for your meshes otherwise you will get the following warning when you build lighting:</p> <ul><li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:Overlapping_UV_Error.PNG"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/b/bb/Overlapping_UV_Error.PNG" alt=""></a></p> <p>Message Log, Lighting Results</p></li></ul> <p>This means that you’ll need to setup a second UV channel for your lightmap otherwise the editor will use the existing texture UV as the lightmap which can lead to these kinds of errors.</p> <p>This can be fixed by adjusting the UV for the lightmap so that there are no overlapping faces.</p> <p>This can be done <a href="#How_do_I_generate_lightmap_UVs_in_the_editor.3F">in the editor</a> via generating lightmaps or by using your modeling software of choice to create and edit your UVs.</p> <ul><li><p>Original UVs and Results</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:Overlapping_LogoUV.PNG"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/6/65/Overlapping_LogoUV.PNG/415px-Overlapping_LogoUV.PNG" alt=""></a></p> <p>Overlapping UVs</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:Overlapping_UV_Results.PNG"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/3/3f/Overlapping_UV_Results.PNG/480px-Overlapping_UV_Results.PNG" alt=""></a></p> <p>Results in Editor</p></li> <li><p>Corrected UVs and Results</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:Overlapping_LogoUV_Adjusted.PNG"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/c/ca/Overlapping_LogoUV_Adjusted.PNG/437px-Overlapping_LogoUV_Adjusted.PNG" alt=""></a></p> <p>Corrected UVs</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:Overlapping_UV_Results_Adjusted.PNG"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/a/a5/Overlapping_UV_Results_Adjusted.PNG/441px-Overlapping_UV_Results_Adjusted.PNG" alt=""></a></p> <p>Results in Editor</p></li></ul> <p>Take notice that the UV in the final result has no overlapping faces which allows shadow/light information to bake correctly for the texture that will be applied to our mesh after the light build.</p> <p>With the overlapping faces these will give incorrect shading due to lighting information not being baked correctly. _________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <h3 id="how-do-i-generate-lightmap-uvs-in-the-editor"><a href="#how-do-i-generate-lightmap-uvs-in-the-editor" class="header-anchor">#</a> How do I generate lightmap UVs in the editor?</h3> <p>With the release of 4.5 the editor will automatically generate UVs on import or by using the mesh editor.</p> <p>We will assume you’re wanting to set them up from the mesh editor.</p> <ul><li><p>Open the mesh you’d like to create a lightmap with.</p></li> <li><p>Locate the panel on the right that looks like this:</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:GeneratedLMs.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/b/b3/GeneratedLMs.png/533px-GeneratedLMs.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Static Mesh Editor Details Panel</p></li></ul> <p>This panel will allow you to create your lightmap channel, but do note that this does not directly control your lightmap resolution or it’s coordinate index assignment.

The key here is making sure that we select the proper source lightmap index. This is the UV that is typically used for the textures. The UV shells/islands in this UV will be repacked so that there are no overlapping faces, which is integral to using lightmaps.</p> <p>For the lightmap resolution setting a low value to begin with is not bad because we are not obligated to using that resolution. If you decide to use a higher resolution you do not need to come back to these settings unless you know it could improve the lightmap bake. In most cases it’s not necessary.</p> <p>Once you’ve hit “Apply Changes” we can verify our lightmap has been created and see if there appears to be any errors.</p> <p>You can do this by going to the mesh editor toolbar and clicking the UV icon to show the UV and using the drop down to the right to select UV channel 1 to view our newly created lightmap.</p> <p>It should look something like this:</p> <ul><li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:UVChannelSelection.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/d/de/UVChannelSelection.png/554px-UVChannelSelection.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Static Mesh Editor, UV Channel Selection</p></li></ul> <p>That’s not quite it though.

For smaller objects this would work well. For larger objects we would possibly need to use higher resolutions.</p> <p>Make sure to adjust it by a power of 2. (ie. 32, 64, 128, 256, etc)</p> <ul><li>The next setting we’ll need to verify is that the Lightmap Coordinate Index is now pointing to the right channel. Make sure this is set to the channel that you set in the build settings above. Typically this should be set to 1.</li></ul> <p>After using these settings you will now have a proper lightmap resolution.</p> <p>There are some caveats to this though that may require the use of a modeling program like Blender, 3Ds Max, or Maya to fully correct the issue.</p> <p>The generated lightmaps will not split or cut seams in the existing UVs from UV channel 1 used for the texture. It will only repack the existing UV layout to better fit the needs of a lightmap UV.</p> <p>As an example, think of a cylinder. If you wanted to lay these faces all out flat you would need to cut a line in the side of the cylinder to do so. In a modeling program this isn’t always necessary depending on how you’ve set up the texture UV to be used. If this side face was not cut to be laid out flat the generated UVs via the mesh editor will not work and will still result in overlapping UVs warning being generated after a light build. _________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <h3 id="how-to-control-global-illumination-with-static-lighting-or-the-wonderful-thing-about-bounce"><a href="#how-to-control-global-illumination-with-static-lighting-or-the-wonderful-thing-about-bounce" class="header-anchor">#</a> How to control Global Illumination with Static Lighting?, or The Wonderful Thing About Bounce</h3> <p>When using static lighting you will need to build lighting to see the results.

Fear not though because we can get rid of those dirty lightmaps with a little scrubbing through our lightmass settings.</p> <p>First though, the reason you see something like this is related to the indirect light from our GI bounces that happen with our lightmass build.</p> <p>To replicate this in a mostly effective way this simple scene will have two rooms.</p> <ul><li><p>Sample Scene</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:1_sceneSetup.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/0/09/1_sceneSetup.png/565px-1_sceneSetup.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Exterior</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:2_sceneSetup.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/c/c0/2_sceneSetup.png/439px-2_sceneSetup.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Interior</p></li></ul> <p>This scene will be using PRODUCTION quality for our light builds. This scene is using assets from the Starter Content pack that can be added to any newly created project. All meshes in the scene will use a lightmap resolution of 256 unless otherwise noted. The post process effects are set to default with eye adaptation to make the darker room easier to see.</p> <p>After building our lighting, here are the results:</p> <ul><li><p>Initial Lighting Build, default settings</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:3_Room1_Clean.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/4/42/3_Room1_Clean.png/553px-3_Room1_Clean.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>1st Interior Room, lit with direct and 1st bounce lighting</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:4_Room2_dirty.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/c/c6/4_Room2_dirty.png/551px-4_Room2_dirty.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>2nd Interior Room, lit entirely with indirect lighting</p></li></ul> <p>Brute force can be used to remove some of the indirect lighting artifacts by increasing the lightmap resolution which effectively increases the size of the textures used to store the lighting and shadowing information, but that’s not always the best idea when a high-quality result can be achieved using a lower resolution and adjusting the lightmass settings. When dealing with any rendering application in the engine and especially lighting just increasing a texture size, though it may appear to solve the issue is not always the most performance friendly way to handle an issue and may even result in more problems further along in your development process.</p> <p>As any example this is the same 2nd Interior Room with lightmap resolution changed to be 1024:</p> <ul><li><p>Initial Lighting Build, default settings</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:4_Room2_dirty.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/c/c6/4_Room2_dirty.png/551px-4_Room2_dirty.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>2nd Interior Room, Lightmap Resolution 256</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:5_lightmap1024.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/7/78/5_lightmap1024.png/550px-5_lightmap1024.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>2nd Interior Room, Lightmap Resolution 1024</p></li></ul> <p>In this example, a lot of the artifacts have been reduced by using the higher lightmap resolution, but this also increases the texture memory footprint by a factor of 4. There is a more performance friendly solution to these Indirect Lighting Artifacts with some simple adjustments to the World Settings.</p> <p><a href="/index.php?title=File:7_World_Settings.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/e/e8/7_World_Settings.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>World Settings</p> <ul><li>You can locate World Settings here:</li></ul> <p><a href="/index.php?title=File:6_LightmassSettings.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/b/b2/6_LightmassSettings.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>World Settings</p> <ul><li>Here the settings for Lightmass can be adjusted:</li></ul> <p><strong>Indirect Lighting Quality</strong>: This will increase the Global Illumination solver counts to get a higher quality for levels that need it.</p> <p><strong>Indirect Lighting Smoothness</strong>: This is the smoothness factor to apply to Indirect Lighting.</p> <p>WARNING: Using a Value greater than 1 in the Indirect Lighting Quality will GREATLY increase build times.</p> <ul><li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:8_settings.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/a/ac/8_settings.png" alt="8 settings.png"></a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:10_settings.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/0/0c/10_settings.png" alt="10 settings.png"></a></p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:9_results.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/8/8a/9_results.png/551px-9_results.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Default Settings</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:11_results.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/4/49/11_results.png/550px-11_results.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Settings Example #1</p></li></ul> <p>As mentioned in How to control Global Illumination with Static Lighting?, or The Wonderful Thing About Bounce, you may also want to adjust the number of indirect light bounces which will yield the following results:</p> <ul><li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:13_results.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/e/e5/13_results.png/551px-13_results.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Num Indirect Lighting Bounces = 4</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:14_Results2.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/1/15/14_Results2.png/551px-14_Results2.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Num Indirect Lighting Bounces = 5</p></li></ul> <p>At this point, the lighting settings have been adjusted enough that there may be room to hide any artifacts with some textures, but if that’s not the option there is the option to bump the lightmap resolution for each mesh up to a higher value. The value used here is 256 for the lightmap resolution. By changing it to be 512 we get the following result:</p> <ul><li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:15_FinalResult.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/0/0a/15_FinalResult.png/551px-15_FinalResult.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Adjust Indirect Settings with 512 Lightmap Resolution</p></li> <li><p><a href="/index.php?title=File:5_lightmap1024.png"><img src="https://d3ar1piqh1oeli.cloudfront.net/7/78/5_lightmap1024.png/550px-5_lightmap1024.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>No Adjustment to Indirect Settings with 1024 Lightmap Resolution</p></li></ul> <p>In the beginning of this tutorial, there was a comparison shown using Lightmaps of 1024 that helped get rid of the artifacts. By adjusting a few lightmass settings the artifacts have been reduced and the assets are using a lower texture resolution with better results.</p> <p>While this method is fully exploring the option of not having any light in this room and looking at ways to reduce the “dirtiness” artifacts that can be caused by Indirect Lighting it must be noted that using lighting can in these areas, even a very low-intensity non-shadow casting light, can get results as well. The methods listed above are a starting point and may require a little trial and error to get the results that are more appealing.</p> <p><a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/Lightmass/Basics/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Want to know more about Lightmass Basics?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p><a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/Lightmass/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Want to know more about Lightmass Global Illumination?<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></p> <p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <h3 id="what-is-the-lighting-needs-to-be-rebuilt-in-the-top-left-corner-error"><a href="#what-is-the-lighting-needs-to-be-rebuilt-in-the-top-left-corner-error" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is the “Lighting needs to be rebuilt” in the Top left corner error?</h3> <p><a href="/index.php?title=File:1_lighting_rebuilt.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/1/11/1_lighting_rebuilt.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Error Message</p> <p>If this is appearing in your top left part of your viewport window when using PIE (Play in Editor), Simulate, or Standalone game this simply means that lighting needs to be rebuilt for your scene.

One important one is the option to override the Lightmap Resolution of the mesh.</p> <p><a href="/index.php?title=File:FoliageLightmap.png"><img src="https://d26ilriwvtzlb.cloudfront.net/6/6d/FoliageLightmap.png" alt=""></a></p> <p>Foliage Lightmap Settings</p> <p>By default this option is disabled, which means that the static meshes own lightmap resolution will be used.</p> <p>You may be thinking “why is this a bad thing? Don’t I want to have a good lightmap resolution for nice baked shadows?”, but the problem here is that when you use the Foliage tool these are not individually placed actors that get their own lightmap. These are all clustered instances where the clusters will be baked down into a single lightmap together.</p> <p>If you have a lot of instances and proceed to build with the static meshes default lightmap resolution you are more likely to be met with a warning that “Instanced_Foliage_Actor_[X] lightmap is too large and should be reduced.” This is a clear indication that the lightmap resolution is too high. You should enable the option above and try a lower resolution like 8 or 4 before you try rebuilding.</p> <p>As a general good practice though you should do the following:</p> <ul><li>Limit the use of static lighting on foliage if you are going to have the trees/grass sway in the wind. It looks unnatural for the foliage to move, but the shadow does not.</li> <li>Reduce the lightmap resolution of foliage to a manageable size.</li> <li>Disable static lighting on grass. This is a general good practice to have since these instances will likely number in the thousands depending on your level and it will significantly increase the light build time in most cases.</li></ul> <p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>Retrieved from &quot;<a href="https://wiki.unrealengine.com/index.php?title=LightingTroubleshootingGuide&amp;oldid=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wiki.unrealengine.com/index.php?title=LightingTroubleshootingGuide&amp;oldid=21<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>&quot;</p> <p><a href="/index.php?title=Special:Categories" title="Special:Categories">Categories</a>:</p> <ul><li><a href="/index.php?title=Category:Tutorials&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Category:Tutorials (page does not exist)">Tutorials</a></li> <li><a href="/index.php?title=Category:Lighting" title="Category:Lighting">Lighting</a></li> <li><a href="/index.php?title=Category:Epic_Created_Content" title="Category:Epic Created Content">Epic Created Content</a></li> <li><a href="/index.php?title=Category:Troubleshooting" title="Category:Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></li></ul></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
