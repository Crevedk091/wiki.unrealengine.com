In this example, T is used to let you know that the type is a template class. So TSharedRef, TWeakPtr, TArray, etc. are all template classes. Having a prefix allows you to easily differentiate type names from variable names, as variable names are not typically declared with a prefix in UE4 source (one notable exception to this is that boolean variable names are prefixed with a 'b').</p> <p>So, in short, those &quot;T things&quot; should make you think two things:</p> <ol><li>You're looking at a type name (and not a variable name).</li> <li>The type name is specifying a template class.</li></ol> <p>There are other prefixes that will appear in the source, such as U, A, S, I, and F.

TheArmor-&gt;Color;
TheArmor-&gt;Size;</p> <p>See? Isn't that easier to read?</p> <p>But wait there's more!</p> <h4 id="access-huge-quantities-of-data-any-time"><a href="#access-huge-quantities-of-data-any-time" class="header-anchor">#</a> Access Huge Quantities of Data Any Time</h4> <p>Pointers can point to relatively small amounts of data, or vast and huge quantities of data!</p> <p>The pointer is pointing to a location in memory,
the actual amount of memory involved could be enormous!</p> <p>So continuing the above example, you might say, &quot;Why don't I just create a copy of the Character's Armor?&quot;</p> <p>FArmorStruct ArmorVar = GetGalaxy()-&gt;GetSolarSystem()-&gt;GetPlanet()-&gt;GetMainCharacter()-&gt;GetCurrentArmor();</p> <p>But what if the FArmorStruct contains a huuuuge amount of data, and you want to do this for 300 Characters across the Galaxy?</p> <p>You would be copying this data many times over!</p> <p>But the data already exists in one memory location.
Why would you copy it over just to access it, thereby duplicating the data?</p> <p>Pointers enable you to avoid this entirely!</p> <p>You can simply point to the one memory location and access it any time.</p> <h4 id="stay-current-with-runtime-changes"><a href="#stay-current-with-runtime-changes" class="header-anchor">#</a> Stay Current With Runtime Changes</h4> <p>Also, in the above case, once you copy the armor data, it is no longer the actual armor of the Character on the other world.</p> <p>You have lost the living connection to the Armor.</p> <p>So if the Character on the other world chooses to change their armor color, you won't know!</p> <p>Pointers give you an actual living, dynamically updated link
to potentially large quantities of data,
that you only want to have to obtain access to once.</p> <p>So again, the correct way:</p> <p>FArmorStruct* TheArmor = &amp; GetGalaxy()-&gt;GetSolarSystem()-&gt;GetPlanet()-&gt;GetMainCharacter()-&gt;GetCurrentArmor();</p> <p>Now you have easy access and a living connection to data that is in a Galaxy far far away,
without ever having to duplicate any data.</p> <h3 id="passing-data-by-reference"><a href="#passing-data-by-reference" class="header-anchor">#</a> Passing Data by Reference</h3> <p>Another use of &amp; is to pass data by reference into functions.</p> <p>This is especially important for very large quantities of data that you would not want to copy into the function context!</p> <p>int32 AMyClass::GetArraySize(TArray&lt;uint8&gt;&amp; MyHugeBinaryArray) const
{
return MyHugeBinaryArray.Num(); //you use . instead of-&gt; because passing by Reference
}</p> <p>If you dont use the &amp;, then you will be copying the entire huge array, just to find out how big it is!</p> <p>Try to pass by reference wherever you can, instead of passing in pointers. It is much saferÂ ðŸ˜ƒ</p> <h2 id="related-epic-tutorial"><a href="#related-epic-tutorial" class="header-anchor">#</a> Related Epic Tutorial</h2> <p><strong><a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/QuickStart/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Programming Quick Start<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a></strong></p> <h2 id="summary-3"><a href="#summary-3" class="header-anchor">#</a> Summary</h2> <p>Feel free to post new questions in the Discussion tab!</p> <p>I hope this helps you to cross the C++ entry barrier and enjoy the power and Beauty of UE4 C++Â !</p> <p><a href="/User:Rama" title="User:Rama">Rama</a> (<a href="/User_talk:Rama" title="User talk:Rama">talk</a>)</p> <p>Retrieved from &quot;<a href="https://wiki.unrealengine.com/index.php?title=Entry_Level_Guide_to_UE4_C%2B%2B&amp;oldid=8264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://wiki.unrealengine.com/index.php?title=Entry_Level_Guide_to_UE4_C%2B%2B&amp;oldid=8264<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>&quot;</p> <p><a href="/Special:Categories" title="Special:Categories">Categories</a>:</p> <ul><li><a href="/Category:Tutorials" title="Category:Tutorials">Tutorials</a></li> <li><a href="/Category:Code" title="Category:Code">Code</a></li> <li><a href="/Category:Community_Created_Content" title="Category:Community Created Content">Community Created Content</a></li></ul></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
